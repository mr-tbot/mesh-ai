## Features

- **Multiple AI Providers**  
  - Support for **Local** models (LM Studio, Ollama), **OpenAI**, and even **Home Assistant** integration.
- **Home Assistant Integration**  
  - Seamlessly forward messages from a designated channel to Home Assistant’s conversation API. Optionally secure the integration using a PIN.
- **Advanced Slash Commands**  
  - Built‑in commands: suffixed `/about-XY`, `/help-XY`, `/motd-XY`, `/whereami-XY`, AI commands with your unique suffix (e.g., `/ai-XY`, `/bot-XY`, `/query-XY`, `/data-XY`), unsuffixed `/test`, and unsuffixed `/emergency` (or `/911`), plus custom commands via `commands_config.json`.
  - Commands are now case‑insensitive for improved mobile usability.
  - New: a per-install randomized alias (e.g. `/ai-9z`) is generated on first run to reduce collisions when multiple bots exist on the same mesh or MQTT network. You can change it in `config.json` (field `ai_command`). All AI commands require this suffix, and other built‑ins (except emergency/911) also require your suffix.
  - Strongly encouraged: customize your commands in `commands_config.json` to avoid collisions with other users.
- **Emergency Alerts**  
  - Trigger alerts that are sent via **Twilio SMS**, **SMTP Email**, and, if enabled, **Discord**.
  - Emergency notifications include GPS coordinates, UTC timestamps, and user messages.
- **Enhanced REST API & WebUI Dashboard**  
  - A modern three‑column layout showing direct messages, channel messages, and available nodes. Stacks on mobile; 3‑wide on desktop. Controls (Suffix, Commands, Config, Logs) live in the “Send a Message” header (top‑right).
  - Additional endpoints include `/messages`, `/nodes`, `/connection_status`, `/logs`, `/logs_stream`, `/send`, `/ui_send`, `/commands_info` (JSON commands list), and a new `/discord_webhook` for inbound Discord messages.
  - UI customization through settings such as theme color, hue rotation, and custom sounds.
  - Config Editor (WebUI): Click the “Config” button in the header to view/edit `config.json`, `commands_config.json`, and `motd.json` in a tabbed editor. JSON is validated before saving; writes are atomic. Some changes may require a restart to take effect.
  - Emoji enhancements: each message has a React button that reveals a compact, hidden emoji picker; choosing an emoji auto‑sends a reaction (DM or channel). The send form includes a Quick Emoji bar that inserts emojis into your draft (does not auto‑send).
- **Improved Message Chunking & Routing**  
  - Automatically splits long AI responses into configurable chunks with delays to reduce radio congestion.
  - Configurable flags control whether the bot replies to broadcast channels and/or direct messages.
  - New: LongFast (channel 0) response toggle — by default the bot will NOT respond on LongFast to avoid congestion. Enable `ai_respond_on_longfast` only if your local mesh agrees.
  - Etiquette: Using AI bots on public LongFast is discouraged; keep it off unless you’re on an isolated/private mesh with community consent.
- **Robust Error Handling & Logging**  
  - Uses UTC‑based timestamps with an auto‑truncating script log file (keeping the last 100 lines if the file grows beyond 100 MB).
  - Enhanced error detection (including specific OSError codes) and graceful reconnection using threaded exception hooks.
- **Discord Integration Enhancements**  
  - Route messages to and from Discord.
  - New configuration options and a dedicated `/discord_webhook` endpoint allow for inbound Discord message processing.
  - MQTT-aware response gating: set `respond_to_mqtt_messages` to true in `config.json` if you want the bot to respond to messages that arrive via MQTT. Off by default to prevent multiple server responses.
  - User‑initiated only: The AI does not auto‑message or greet new nodes; it responds only to explicit user input.
- **Commands modal & startup helper**
  - WebUI includes a Commands modal (button in the “Send a Message” header) that lists available commands with descriptions.
  - The current alias suffix and a one‑line commands list are printed at startup for easy reference.
- **Windows & Linux Focused**
  - Official support for Windows environments with installation guides; instructions for Linux available now - MacOS coming soon!

## Changelog

### New Updates in v0.5.1 → v0.6.0 - SAFETY, STABILITY & COMMUNITY RESPECT
- **Mesh safety defaults**
  - LongFast (channel 0) responses are OFF by default; enable `ai_respond_on_longfast` only if your mesh agrees.
  - MQTT response gating: new `respond_to_mqtt_messages` flag (default `false`) to prevent multiple servers from replying at once over MQTT.
  - Community note: Using AI bots on public LongFast channels is generally frowned upon because it increases congestion for everyone. The toggle remains available for isolated/private deployments or special cases, but it is off by default.
- **Bot‑loop prevention**
  - All AI replies now start with a tiny fixed marker `m@i` (≤ 3 chars). Other MESH‑AI instances ignore messages that begin with this marker.
  - Each instance also remembers node IDs that send AI‑tagged messages and ignores further requests from those nodes to mitigate bot‑to‑bot chatter.
- **User‑initiated only**
  - No features are planned that allow the AI to auto‑respond to “join/arrive” events or otherwise talk without an explicit message from a legitimate user.
- **Per‑install command alias**
  - On first run, a randomized alias (e.g. `/ai-9z`) is generated and saved as `ai_command` in `config.json`. Use it to avoid collisions; you can change it anytime.
  - Strongly encouraged: customize your commands in `commands_config.json` to minimize collisions on shared meshes/MQTT.
- **No chain‑of‑thought on mesh**
  - A global sanitizer removes any “thinking”/reasoning content before sending. This includes XML‑style tags (e.g. `<thinking>…</thinking>`), fenced blocks, YAML/JSON meta fields, and heading lines.
  - Applied consistently across all providers (LM Studio, OpenAI, Ollama) and Home Assistant so only final answers are transmitted.
- **Ollama reliability**
  - Added keep‑alive and request options, simple retries on transient failures, and response normalization plus sanitization for cleaner output.
- **WebUI**
  - Fixed ticker behavior: it now correctly honors read/unread state for both DMs and channel messages, and dismissals persist across refreshes.
  - Refined layout: Direct Messages, Channel Messages, and Available Nodes order; mobile stacking with 3‑wide desktop; controls moved to the “Send a Message” header (top‑right).
  - New Commands modal overlay: quickly view available commands and descriptions (via the Commands button). Backed by a lightweight JSON endpoint (`/commands_info`).
  - Scrollable panels with sensible max heights; on mobile, each panel can be collapsed/expanded for easier navigation.
  - Ticker UX polish: dismiss button is reliably visible and auto‑hides after a short timeout; dismiss state is remembered across refreshes.
  - Footer badge updated and repositioned: bottom‑right two‑line, centered label “MESH-AI v0.6.0 PR” and “by: MR-TBOT”.
  - Emoji reactions: every message now includes a React button that toggles a hidden emoji picker; picking an emoji auto‑sends a reaction (works for both DMs and channel messages).
  - Quick Emoji bar: the “Send a Message” form includes common emojis; clicking inserts into your draft at the cursor without auto‑sending.
  - Reaction feedback: React buttons show Sending/Sent/Failed states and temporarily disable during send to prevent accidental double‑presses.
- **Docs & help**
  - Updated README and in‑app `/help` to highlight safety defaults, MQTT gating, and your unique alias.
  - New config keys summarized above; defaults favor safety and reduce congestion.

### New Updates in v0.4.2 → v0.5.1 - NOW IN BETA!
- **REBRANDED TO MESH-AI** 
- **WebUI Enhancements**  
  - **Node Search** added for easier node management.  
  - **Channel Message Organization** with support for custom channels in `config.json`.  
  - **Revamped DM threaded messaging** system.

  - **Timezone Selection** for accurate incoming message timestamps.
  - **Custom Local Sounds** for message notifications (no longer relying on hosted files).
  - **Logs Page Auto-Refresh** for live updates.
- **Baudrate Adjustment**  
  - Configurable **baud rate** in `config.json` for longer USB connections (e.g., roof nodes).
- **LM Studio Model Selection**  
  - Support for selecting models when multiple are loaded in LM Studio, enabling multi-model instances.
- **Protobuf Noise Debugging**  
  - Moved any protobuf-related errors behind debug logs as they do not affect functionality.  
  - Can be enabled by setting `"debug": true` in `config.json` to track.
- **Updated Docker Support**  
  - Updated Docker configuration to always pull/build the latest Meshtastic-Python libraries, ensuring compatibility with Protobuf versions.
### POSSIBLE BUGS IN BETA v0.5.1 - Web UI ticker isn't honoring read messages in some cases.
### INCOMING MESSAGE SOUNDS ARE UNTESTED ON ALL PLATFORMS AND FILESYSTEMS.

### New Updates in v0.4.1 → v0.4.2
- **Initial Ubuntu & Ollama Unidecode Support: -**  
  - User @milo_o - Thank you so much!  I have merged your idea into the main branch - hoping this works as expected for users - please report any problems!  -  https://github.com/mr-tbot/mesh-ai/discussions/19
- **Emergency Email Google Maps Link:**  
  - Emergency email now includes a Google Maps link to the sender's location, rather than just coordinates. - Great call, @Nlantz79!  (Remember - this is only as accurate as the sender node's location precision allows!)

### New Updates in v0.4.0 → v0.4.1
- **Error Handling (ongoing):**  
  - Trying a new method to handle WinError exceptions - which though much improved in v0.4.0 - still occur under the right connection circumstances - especially over Wi-Fi.  
     (**UPDATE: My WinError issues were being caused by a combination of low solar power, and MQTT being enabled on my node.  MQTT - especially using LongFast is very intense on a node, and can cause abrupt connection restarts as noted here:  https://github.com/meshtastic/meshtastic/pull/901 - but - now the script is super robust regardless for handling errors!)**
- **Emergency Email Subject:**  
  - Email Subject now includes the long name, short name & Node ID of the sending node, rather than just the Node ID.
- **INITIAL Docker Support**  

### New Updates in v0.3.0 → v0.4.0
- **Logging & Timestamps:**  
  - Shift to UTC‑based timestamps and enhanced log management.
- **Discord Integration:**  
  - Added configuration for inbound/outbound Discord message routing.
  - Introduced a new `/discord_webhook` endpoint for processing messages from Discord.
- **Emergency Notifications:**  
  - Expanded emergency alert logic to include detailed context (GPS data, UTC time) and Discord notifications.
- **Sending and receiving SMS:**  
  - Send SMS using `/sms <+15555555555> <message>`
  - Config options to either route incoming Twilio SMS messages to a specific node, or a channel index.
- **Command Handling:**  
  - Made all slash commands case‑insensitive to improve usability.
  - Enhanced custom command support via `commands_config.json` with dynamic AI prompt insertion.
- **Improved Error Handling & Reconnection:**  
  - More granular detection of connection errors (e.g., specific OSError codes) and use of a global reset event for reconnects.
- **Code Refactoring:**  
  - Overall code improvements for maintainability and clarity, with additional debug prints for troubleshooting.

### Changelog: v0.2.2 → v0.3.0 (from the original Main Branch README)
- **WebUI Overhaul:**  
  - Redesigned three‑column dashboard showing channel messages, direct messages, and node list.
  - New send‑message form with toggleable modes (broadcast vs. direct), dynamic character counting, and message chunk preview.
- **Improved Error Handling & Stability:**  
  - Redirected stdout/stderr to a persistent `script.log` file with auto‑truncation.
  - Added a connection monitor thread to detect disconnections and trigger automatic reconnects.
  - Implemented a thread exception hook for better error logging.

## Quick Start (Docker)

1. **Prerequisites**  
   - Docker installed on your host (Linux, macOS, Windows or Raspberry Pi).  (Current Images Built for Linux x86 & ARM64 Raspberry Pi)
   - Docker support is currently untested on Windows & MacOS, and the Raspberry Pi image remains fresh and untested - please report back!
   - A Meshtastic device connected via USB or WiFi (No Bluetooth testing Done as of yet)
   - If needed,uncomment USB sections and set identifiers such as `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `\\.\COM3`.

2. **Prepare the Volume Structure**  
   - In the root of your project directory:
   - Extract the "docker-required-volumes.zip" - The included "config" & "logs" folders should be within your "mesh-ai folder"
   - This file structure differs from the standard release to accommodate volumes for docker
   - These files are placed in order to prevent docker from replacing these with directories on first start and throwing errors.
   - Make any changes to config files as needed before moving forward.

File structure should look like this:

   ```bash
   mesh-ai/
   ├── config/
   │   ├── config.json
   │   ├── commands_config.json
   │   └── motd.json
   └── logs/
    ├── script.log
    ├── messages.log
    └── messages_archive.json
```


3. **Pull & run the Docker Image using docker-compose**
   - An example docker-compose-yaml is included in the github repository - please adjust as needed.
   - From the project directory, run:
   ```bash
   docker pull mrtbot/mesh-ai:latest
   docker-compose up -d
  

4. **Access the WebUI Dashboard:**  
   - Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000/dashboard](http://localhost:5000/dashboard).

## Basic Usage

- **Interacting with the AI:**  
  - Use your randomized alias shown at startup (e.g., `/ai-9z`) — AI commands require the suffix: `/ai-9z`, `/bot-9z`, `/query-9z`, `/data-9z` followed by your message.
  - To avoid collisions (multiple bots responding), prefer your unique alias and/or customize commands in `commands_config.json`.
  - For direct messages, simply DM the AI node if configured to reply.
- **Location Query:**  
  - Send `/whereami-XY` (replace `XY` with your suffix) to retrieve the node’s GPS coordinates (if available).
- **Emergency Alerts:**  
  - Trigger an emergency using `/emergency <message>` or `/911 <message>`.  
    - These commands send alerts via Twilio, SMTP, and Discord (if enabled), including GPS data and timestamps.
- **Sending and receiving SMS:**  
  - Send SMS using your suffixed command, e.g., `/sms-9z <+15555555555> <message>`
  - Config options to either route incoming Twilio SMS messages to a specific node, or a channel index.
- **Home Assistant Integration:**  
  - When enabled, messages sent on the designated Home Assistant channel (as defined by `"home_assistant_channel_index"`) are forwarded to Home Assistant’s conversation API.
  - In secure mode, include the PIN in your message (format: `PIN=XXXX your message`).
- **WebUI Messaging:**  
  - Use the dashboard’s send‑message form to send broadcast or direct messages. The mode toggle and node selection simplify quick replies.

### WebUI Config Editor (new)

- Open the dashboard and click the “Config” button in the header (next to Commands/Logs).
- A tabbed editor appears with three files:
  - `config.json` — core app settings (providers, timeouts, routing, integrations, etc.)
  - `commands_config.json` — custom slash commands and AI prompts
  - `motd.json` — the Message of the Day string shown in the UI
- Make edits and click Save. The editor validates JSON before saving (for JSON files) and writes changes atomically to prevent partial/corrupted updates.
- Changes to some settings may require restarting the app/container to take effect (e.g., provider, connectivity, or Discord/Twilio credentials).
- Security note: If you expose the WebUI beyond localhost, protect access to the dashboard since configuration files may contain secrets (API keys, tokens).

### How AI messages are identified and ignored by other bots

- AI responses include a very short prefix marker `m@i` at the start of the message body. This is not configurable on purpose and is capped at 3 characters to conserve airtime.
- Other MESH-AI instances will ignore messages that start with this marker, preventing bots from talking to each other.
- Each instance also tracks node IDs that have sent AI-tagged messages and ignores further messages from those nodes.

#### What is bot‑looping and why is it a problem?
- Bot‑looping happens when two or more automated agents see each other’s messages as prompts and keep replying back and forth without a human in the loop.
- On a constrained LoRa mesh, this can quickly saturate airtime (especially on LongFast), drain batteries, and crowd out legitimate traffic.
- Loops can be surprisingly hard to break because:
  - Messages may be re‑broadcast via MQTT and multiple gateways, multiplying replies.
  - Nodes can buffer/retry after brief outages, re‑triggering the loop even if you silence one side.
  - Different bots might parse/quote each other in ways that keep producing “valid” prompts.
- MESH‑AI mitigations:
  - A fixed 3‑char marker (`m@i`) at the start of AI replies so other instances will ignore them.
  - A memory of node IDs that have emitted AI‑tagged messages to avoid engaging those nodes.
  - Conservative defaults: no LongFast replies by default and MQTT response gating disabled by default.
  - Policy: the AI never initiates conversations or responds to arrival/presence events—only explicit human messages.

  Load the current contents of `config.json`, `commands_config.json`, and `motd.json` for the WebUI Config Editor.
 - **POST `/config_editor/save`**  
  Save updates to the above files. Payload is validated (JSON where applicable) and written atomically. Some settings require an app restart to apply.
- **POST `/send`** and **POST `/ui_send`**  
  Send messages programmatically.
- **POST `/discord_webhook`**  
  Receive messages from Discord (if configured).

## Home Assistant & LLM API Integration

### Home Assistant Integration
- **Enable Integration:**  
  - Set `"home_assistant_enabled": true` in `config.json`.
- **Configure:**  
  - Set `"home_assistant_url"` (e.g., `http://homeassistant.local:8123/api/conversation/process`).
  - Provide `"home_assistant_token"` and adjust `"home_assistant_timeout"`.
- **Security (Optional):**  
  - Enable `"home_assistant_enable_pin": true` and set `"home_assistant_secure_pin"`.
- **Routing:**  
  - Messages on the channel designated by `"home_assistant_channel_index"` are forwarded to Home Assistant.  
  - When PIN mode is enabled, include your PIN in the format `PIN=XXXX your message`.

### LLM API Integration
- **LM Studio:**  
  - Set `"ai_provider": "lmstudio"` and configure `"lmstudio_url"`. - optionally set model and text embedding flags as well if using more than one model on the same LM-Studio instance.
- **OpenAI:**  
  - Set `"ai_provider": "openai"`, provide your API key in `"openai_api_key"`, and choose a model.

## Communication Integrations

### Email Integration
- **Enable Email Alerts:**  
  - Set `"enable_smtp": true` in `config.json`.
- **Configure SMTP:**  
  - Provide the following settings in `config.json`:
    - `"smtp_host"` (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`)
    - `"smtp_port"` (use `465` for SSL or another port for TLS)
    - `"smtp_user"` (your email address)
    - `"smtp_pass"` (your email password or app-specific password)

### Discord Integration: Detailed Setup & Permissions

![483177250_1671387500130340_6790017825443843758_n](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0042b7a9-8ec9-4492-8668-25ac977a74cd)


#### 1. Create a Discord Bot
- **Access the Developer Portal:**  
  Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and sign in with your Discord account.
- **Create a New Application:**  
  Click on "New Application," give it a name (e.g., *MESH-AI Bot*), and confirm.
- **Add a Bot to Your Application:**  
  - Select your application, then navigate to the **Bot** tab on the left sidebar.  
  - Click on **"Add Bot"** and confirm by clicking **"Yes, do it!"**  
  - Customize your bot’s username and icon if desired.

#### 2. Set Up Bot Permissions
- **Required Permissions:**  
  Your bot needs a few basic permissions to function correctly:
  - **View Channels:** So it can see messages in the designated channels.
  - **Send Messages:** To post responses and emergency alerts.
  - **Read Message History:** For polling messages from a channel (if polling is enabled).
  - **Manage Messages (Optional):** If you want the bot to delete or manage messages.
- **Permission Calculator:**  
  Use a tool like [Discord Permissions Calculator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html) to generate the correct permission integer.  
  For minimal functionality, a permission integer of **3072** (which covers "Send Messages," "View Channels," and "Read Message History") is often sufficient.

#### 3. Invite the Bot to Your Server
- **Generate an Invite Link:**  
  Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your bot’s client ID (found in the **General Information** tab) in the following URL:
  ```url
  https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=3072&scope=bot
  ```
- **Invite the Bot:**  
  Open the link in your browser, select the server where you want to add the bot, and authorize it. Make sure you have the “Manage Server” permission in that server.

#### 4. Configure Bot Credentials in `config.json`
Update your configuration file with the following keys (replace placeholder text with your actual values):
```json
{
  "enable_discord": true,
  "discord_webhook_url": "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL",
  "discord_receive_enabled": true,
  "discord_bot_token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
  "discord_channel_id": "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID",
  "discord_inbound_channel_index": 1,  // or the channel number you prefer
  "discord_send_ai": true,
  "discord_send_emergency": true
}
```
- **discord_webhook_url:**  
  Create a webhook in your desired Discord channel (Channel Settings → Integrations → Webhooks) and copy its URL.
- **discord_bot_token & discord_channel_id:**  
  Copy your bot’s token from the Developer Portal and enable message polling by specifying the channel ID where the bot should read messages.  
  To get a channel ID, enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode) then right-click the channel and select "Copy ID."

#### 5. Polling Integration (Optional)
- **Enable Message Polling:**  
  Set `"discord_receive_enabled": true` to allow the bot to poll for new messages.
- **Routing:**  
  The configuration key `"discord_inbound_channel_index"` determines the channel number used by MESH-AI for routing incoming Discord messages. Make sure it matches your setup.

#### 6. Testing Your Discord Setup
- **Restart MESH-AI:**  
  With the updated configuration, restart your bot.
- **Check Bot Activity:**  
  Verify that the bot is present in your server, that it can see messages in the designated channel, and that it can send responses.  
- **Emergency Alerts & AI Responses:**  
  Confirm that emergency alerts and AI responses are being posted in Discord as per your configuration (`"discord_send_ai": true` and `"discord_send_emergency": true`).

#### 7. Troubleshooting Tips
- **Permissions Issues:**  
  If the bot isn’t responding or reading messages, double-check that its role on your server has the required permissions.
- **Channel IDs & Webhook URLs:**  
  Verify that you’ve copied the correct channel IDs and webhook URLs (ensure no extra spaces or formatting issues).
- **Bot Token Security:**  
  Keep your bot token secure. If it gets compromised, regenerate it immediately from the Developer Portal.

---

### Twilio Integration
- **Enable Twilio:**  
  - Set `"enable_twilio": true` in `config.json`.
- **Configure Twilio Credentials:**  
  - Provide your Twilio settings in `config.json`:
    - `"twilio_sid": "YOUR_TWILIO_SID"`
    - `"twilio_auth_token": "YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN"`
    - `"twilio_from_number": "YOUR_TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER"`
    - `"alert_phone_number": "DESTINATION_PHONE_NUMBER"` (the number to receive emergency SMS)
- **Usage:**  
  - When an emergency is triggered, the bot sends an SMS containing the alert message (with a Google Maps link if GPS data is available).
- **Tip:**  
  - Follow [Twilio's setup guide](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account) to obtain your SID and Auth Token, and ensure that your phone numbers are verified.

## Other Important Settings

- **Logging & Archives:**  
  - Script logs are stored in `script.log` and message logs in `messages.log`.
  - An archive is maintained in `messages_archive.json` to keep recent messages.
  
- **Device Connection:**  
  - Configure the connection method for your Meshtastic device by setting either the `"serial_port"` or enabling `"use_wifi"` along with `"wifi_host"` and `"wifi_port"`.  
  - Alternatively, enable `"use_mesh_interface"` if applicable.
  - Baud Rate is optionally set if you need - this is for longer USB runs (roof nodes connected via USB) and bad USB connections.
  
- **Message Routing & Commands:**  
  - Custom commands can be added in `commands_config.json`.
  - The WebUI Dashboard (accessible at [http://localhost:5000/dashboard](http://localhost:5000/dashboard)) displays messages and node status.
  
- **AI Provider Settings:**  
  - Adjust `"ai_provider"` and related API settings (timeouts, models, etc.) for LM Studio, OpenAI, Ollama, or Home Assistant integration.
  
- **Security:**  
  - If using Home Assistant with PIN protection, follow the specified format (`PIN=XXXX your message`) to ensure messages are accepted.
  
- **Testing:**  
  - You can test SMS sending with your suffixed `/sms-XY` command or trigger an emergency alert to confirm that Twilio and email integrations are functioning.
